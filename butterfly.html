    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">This project is based on the idea of <b>3Rs: Replicate, Redesign and Repurpose.</b> The process included replication of an existing visualisation to understand the design decisions that were taken, in order to redesign the same for better communication. The last part was to repurpose the same data for a different medium.</p>

    <h2>Visualisation: An animated chart of 42 North American butterflies</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">I chose a visualisation depicting 42 North American butterflies made by Eleanor Lutz who is an information designer specializing in science communication. She described the visualisation as a chart of decorative species including basic information about each butterfly.</p>
   
    <h2>Replicate</h2>
    <p>The first step was to replicate the visualisation. It included understanding the skills, trying to understand design decisons involved in making the visualisation, identification of the different layers, recreating the visuals and animating them as close as possible to the original visualisation.</p>

    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">It was an insightful process which led to systematic exploration and insights. However, there were many areas of dilemma and confusion as the design decisions involved in the process followed by the designer of the original visualisation couldn’t be fully decoded. It restricted me from constructively critiquing the visualization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('butterfly/1.gif'); padding-top: 162%; margin-bottom: 0px;"></div>
    <div class="imagesubtitle" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Replicated Visualisation</div>

    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">Replicating the visualisation helped me understand the design decisions taken by the designer. It also helped me in identifying the layers of the visualisation containing different data like common name, scientific name, specimen size and geo location of the butterfly. Recreating the existing visualisation also helped me discover data that wasn’t being used properly, about the flapping patten of the butterflies. As the designer meant this visualisation to be a decorative one rather than an educational one, the butterflies became the centre of attraction and the information was not in the spotlight.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Redesign</h2>
    <p>The information provided in the visualisation was underutilised and unclear as the emphasis was majorly on the butterflies. I took this as an opportunity to explore the different possibilities of communicating the data effectively. I then categorised the information as follows:<br><br>
        Size of the butterflies<br>
        Flapping of their wings<br>
        Common and Scientific name<br>
        Visual appearance of the butterflies<br><br>
    I chose to not include the geographical location of this information it did not fit well into the range of data that I chose to work with. I chose to make the visualisation more butterfly centric both in terms of information and visual representation.</p>

    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">Redesigning this set of data provides a way to visually compare. This visual democracy allows the viewer to understand the data themselves and make correlations. The key here is to decide a narrative that the user will follow in order to decode the visualisation. As the critique of the visualisation is based on only one side of the story, this led me to redesign with a personal perspective. My goal for the visualisation was different and it involved a different set of data. This helped me in maintaining rigour.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('butterfly/2.gif'); padding-top: 122%; margin-bottom: 0px;"></div>
    <div class="imagesubtitle" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Redesigned Visualisation</div>

    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 54px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">The redesigned version represented the four set of information as:<br><br>The butterflies were separated into three categories based on their size. The original visualisation depicted all butterflies in the same size which can lead to misinterpretation of their sizes.<br><br>The pattern of flapping their wings was in three different angles and at different time intervals. This information was provided through animation and reinforced using dots and dashes.<br><br>After multiple iterations, I chose concentric circles to depict the information as I found it to be the best way to represent the butterflies harmoniously without creating chaos</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Repurpose</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">I repurposed the visualisation to a tangible medium as I had already explored the digital medium. I wanted to translate this information into a tangible medium which lets the user experience the information through an interactive butterfly.<br><br>A butterfly is very hard to observe in order to understand their detail. Hence, creating something that explains how different butterflies flap their wings would be experiential as well as easy to understand. This part of the 3R process included exploration with different materials.</p>

    <div class="imagesubtitle" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Repurposed Visualisation</div>

    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 54px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">I created a tangible butterfly using an automated system which comprises a microcontroller that controls the flapping of the butterflies through a servo motor.<br>I abstracted the butterfly into simple shapes. According to the designed system the butterfly flaps its wings in different ways when given the command to do so.</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The whole process of trying to understand and critique in order to better communicate was interesting. It helped me understand how important maintaining rigour is in the process of redesign and repurpose by considering essential things into the design process like defining the scope and goal, mentioning the simplifying assumptions and acknowledging professional judgement.</p>
