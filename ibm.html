    <h1>IBM Internship</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Here are some details (mostly my experience) of my internship with IBM, Bangalore.</p>
    <div class="projectpagetags" style="margin-bottom: 54px;">
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:16px; margin-right: 8px; color: #313131;">May - Jun 2019</p>
        <p class="tagbox">internship</p>
        <p class="tagbox">visual design</p>
    </div>

    <p style="line-height: 40px; margin-bottom: 54px;">My Role: Visual Designer<br>
    Mentors: Jatin Tilwani, Anneysha Biswas<br>
    Team: AP Above Market Team
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">In the summer of 2019, I interned with IBM for two months. It was a beautiful campus and I loved the little corner assigned to me. After two days of orientation I met my team and they were nice and welcoming. The team was made with designers, developers, content writers, the project manager, myself (the design intern) and a content writer intern.<br><br>The structure of the team facilitated a very systematic flow of work starting from the content writers to the designers and finally the developers and it was all coordinated by the project managers. There was just so much to learn and everything was new and exciting!</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><b style="font-weight: 600;">All of my work and many of the finer details are covered by an NDA.</b></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">My work was to come up with the identity and the accompanying design language for a campaign and to work on marketing collaterals for many ongoing campaigns for internal IBM stakeholders. The process included understanding the system and information, visualising it, rounds of feedback and execution after team discussions. I was a part of every team discussion and everyone was involved at every stage, be it the ideation of the narration or the content or the design or the development, there was a lot of freedom to explore!</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">The biggest challenge I faced was to figure out how I can use my skill to work with the design guidelines in IBM. The team was working together for quite some years and had this amazing understanding and distribution of work. The flow of work was so harmonious and it helped me handle deadlines and learn a much more organised work ethic. <br><br>The nature of the work and every campaign that we worked on were distinct and diverse. As a visual designer it required me to have an in-depth understanding of the ongoing campaign and at a point I was creating assets for multiple campaigns in parallel. <br><br>The various projects I worked on included regular communication and feedback from the stakeholders and more team discussions to reflect on our work and get internal feedback. It was a very constructive and encouraging atmosphere.</p>

    <p>I absolutely loved the work and the people and I learnt a lot of things related and unrelated to design as well (this includes an ethical hacker teaching a bunch of us about how he extracted so much of our personal details from Facebook and so easily!! I was shocked!!). In my session to teach something new I introduced Game design :P and learnt some facts about automobile design from another intern. Okay, I am gonna stop mentioning how much fun it was now.</p>
