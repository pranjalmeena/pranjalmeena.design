    <h1>Tessact - Website Design</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Established a Visual Design System of the website including layout, typography, illustration style and microinteractions, and led the website design efforts.</p>

        <p class="p5" style="font-size:16px; margin-right: 8px; color: #313131;">Feb - Apr 2020</p>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">I interned with Tessact in the first few months of the year 2020. I was a part of their design team and I took up the lead to design their website. Tessact has its own design system for the product applications and services it provides. However, their internet presence did not resonate with their product style and design.</p>

    <h2>About Tessact</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">Tessact is a startup which creates AI driven tools to benefit the media industry. It is a data analytics company creating powerful video recognition technologies built on advanced machine learning systems. They are working with one of the leading media companies in India like SONY, Viacom 18 and 9x Media.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>My role here was to create a design system for their internet presence which can be used to create multiple platforms to market their company.</p>
    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 32px;">I worked closely with developers and content writers to understand the nuances of website development and limitations.</blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">To design the system I adopted the atomic design methodology by Brad Frost. The aim behind this was to establish consistency for a coherent look and feel, faster development of assets and easier communication through shared knowledge.<br><br>I first created an information architecture. This required me to study the content, organise and group them to create sections and achieve a flow in the information. After multiple iterations and team discussions I reached a definitive version of information architecture.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>I started out by designing the style guide which describes the visual details of the design system like typographic scale, colour palettes, grid definition and iconography. This helped me to establish consistency in all the elements of the website.</p>
    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Defining a style guide can also help other designers to understand and implement the defined design language while creating design assets for the company.</blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">This also helped in reinforcing the position of Tessact in the market and increased the value of the company by creating an identity.</p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('tessact/1.jpg'); padding-top: 53%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">The visual elements were highly influenced by their product application design. The colour palette included a range of blues and greys. The greys had a tint of blue to maintain balance of the cool colours. These colours were defined for every element in the background and text.<br><br>Similarly, the grid used here is a 2x grid to define the layout. This also helped in extending the design to multiple devices and to create and maintain a visual rhythm.<br><br>Typography was used effectively to guide the user through the contents for easy understanding of the information hierarchy. The different weights and sizes were key to achieve the same.<br><br>The style guide also included the illustration style. I used flat style illustrations as it provided us with an opportunity to introduce motion graphics in the future. I used geometric shapes to create objects and used colours to give the illustration balance and depth.</p>

    <h2>Atomic Design System</h2>
    <p>After defining all the guidelines I started creating elements. To do so I first designed the smallest and the most crucial elements like buttons, navigation bar, labels, icons, etc. These elements were used extensively throughout the design and provided uniformity.</p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('tessact/3.jpg'); padding-top: 40%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p>The next step was to bring these atoms together and make molecules that have unique properties and characteristics. To do so I grouped different information together to create a sense of order and to organise information in a better way. </p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('tessact/4.jpg'); padding-top: 75%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p>The next step was to combine the different molecules to form organisms. The information flow included repetition of many of these molecules to form organisms, but some of them were standalone organisms with unique functionalities. </p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('tessact/5.jpg'); padding-top: 94%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">These organisms made it easier to form Pages as they helped me visualise the complex information in multiple ways to reach the final design. Here are some of the Pages that I designed. The final design process also involved decisions on the microinteractions. </p>

    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('tessact/6.jpg'); padding-top: 144%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p>I learnt a lot from this experience, from Team Dynamics to how every role is important in realising the final product, be it a designer or a developer or a content writer. It was a really long project and took a lot of effort to finish. But it was thrilling to put my best out there using these new methods and exploring newer frontiers everyday.</p>
