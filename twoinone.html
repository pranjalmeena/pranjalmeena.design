    <h1>Two in One Book</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Designed a book that captures the introspective juxtaposition of perceptions of two individuals from two different backgrounds.</p>
    <div class="projectpagetags" style="margin-bottom: 54px;">
        <p class="p5" style="font-size:16px; margin-right: 8px; color: #313131;">Oct - Dec 2019</p>
        <p class="tagbox">germany</p>
        <p class="tagbox">artistic book</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">So, let’s just say me and Yunju Cho wanted to make a book. The idea was to collaborate with one another and come to a common understanding to make an artistic book. A book which expresses us both individually but together.</p>

    <h2>What did we do first?</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">We started with some basic introduction of each other, to understand our backgrounds better. We talked about a lot of things starting from the country we were in at that time and the country we to belonged to. Sometimes we related to each other and sometimes we didn’t. This was the initial phase of our project where we discovered that many things about our cultures were similar. In order to understand each other creatively we performed a set of activities.</p>

    <h2 style="font-style: italic;">PING PONG</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 16px;">Why? Because she continued from wherever I left and vice versa!</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">We developed ideas and games to show traces of an incident on a sheet of paper. (Dancing, Meeting, Communication, Interaction, and Non Communication etc.). We played a series of games to accomplish the objective of Ping - Pong.</p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('twoinone/2.jpg'); padding-top: 44%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>
   
    <h2>Final Concept</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">The concept is based on our understanding of each other and it is an expression of what we feel and think. What is it that we notice about each other ? Or like about each other ? What fascinates us ? What gives me a shocked or a surprised feeling about her? What do I feel around her environment ? Is it necessarily happy because she is? Or is her room duller and she is totally opposite of dull ? Maybe it is or maybe it is not!<br><br>What does she think of me and what do I think of her is what we wanted to capture. We chose to express the same through common objects and situations and show the contrast. The contrast is what puts us both into one frame to reveal what we both think about each other and how visually it is different.</p>

    <h2>Contents of the Book</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">The book starts with an introductory text that questions our understanding of things and how it may differ form others. It goes like this:</p>
    <div style="margin: 0px auto; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">Hello,<br> Do you always know how you feel or think? Do you ever sit back and really think about how you feel? Or Is it intuitive? What is it that you notice about others? Or like about others? What fascinates you? What gives you a shocked or a surprised feeling about someone? What do you feel around others? Is it necessarily happy because they are? Or their surroundings seem dull but they are totally opposite of dull? Maybe it is or maybe it is not! So do you always understand everything around you as it should be? Who decides how it should be? Do you decide it?</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">The book circles back to the same question again but with respect to me and Yunju. The text for the same goes like this:</p>
    <div style="margin: 0px auto 12px; width: calc(100% - 120px);">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; line-height: 24px;">Hello again!<br>So do you think you know how Pranjal and Yunju think? Did you understand them? Do you think how you think is how they think also?<br><br>Is there an answer to these questions?<br>Maybe No!<br>Maybe Yes!</p>
