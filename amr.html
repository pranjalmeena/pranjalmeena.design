    <h1>AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance)</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Designed series of visualisations to spread awareness on Antimicrobial Resistance in India. Analysed data about AMR, studied and researched about behavioural psychology in the context, to focus the project for providing the necessary knowledge on the topic for students.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">Antimicrobials have proven to be one of the most successful methods of medical treatment since their invention. They have been in use for more than half a century to treat infectious diseases in humans and in various other fields like agriculture, veterinary, aquaculture, etc.<br><br>However, over the years the perception of antimicrobials being the ultimate saviour has led to their overuse. The increased use and misuse of antimicrobials has accelerated the natural process in which microbes develop a natural resistance to resist their noxious effect. </p>

    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 54px;">With the increased globalisation, antimicrobial resistance becomes a very big threat.</blockquote>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">Antimicrobial resistance has become a global concern over the years. The global connectivity through travel or exchange of resources is a potential source for transmission of resistant strains.  The World Health Organisation has declared Antimicrobial Resistance as one of the three major health related warnings in the 21st century. Antimicrobial resistance is a bigger threat to people than cancer and road accidents combined. </p>


    <h2>Research</h2>
    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('amr/1.jpg'); padding-top: 75%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>
    
    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;"><i>Knowledge about AMR results in behaviour change, which is no longer influenced by social norms<br><br>There is an inadequate understanding of AMR. Good practices like finishing the prescribed course of medicines exist, but the knowledge as to why, doesn’t<br><br>Non-Medical stream students rarely come across topics like AMR, academically or otherwise, so introducing it at a common stage will be beneficial</i></p>
   
    <h2>Final Concept</h2>
    <p>Based on my insights, I finalised the design brief to create awareness of Antimicrobial Resistance in students 18 - 25 years of age through visualisations. These visualisations are meant to be used in campaigns conducted for students in their respective institutions.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Narrative</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The final narrative contains 3 visualisations:<br>
    Part 1: What is antimicrobial resistance, how it happens and spreads?<br>
    Part 2: Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance<br>
    Part 3: How can you prevent it as an individual</p>

    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('amr/2.jpg');padding-top: 44%; margin-bottom: 0px;"></div>
    <div class="imagesubtitle" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">This mindmap provides a detailed look into the kind of questions the visualisations address</div>

    <p>Though each and every narrative was too broad by itself, they were all necessary for a complete understanding of Antimicrobial Resistance. I started the process by collecting appropriate information and modifying it based on multiple levels of feedback.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Visual Design</h2>
    <p>I started the process by exploring different styles through which I can explain the concept. Initially I was inspired by David S Goodsell's work and explored the designs that he makes. However, the paintings were too complex, so I tried to decrease the detail for clarity.<br><br>I simplified the structure of the bacteria even more by moving away from a complex style of depiction. I further ideated and referred to the textbooks of NCERT syllabus to understand how detailed the diagrams are in school textbooks. The students will understand the visuals in more depth if they match the style of the NCERT textbooks through association.</p>

    <div class="projectimagelong" style="background-image: url('amr/3.jpg'); padding-top: 45%; margin-bottom: 32px;"></div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">For designing the final visualisation style I started with a rough sketch of the visualisation which contained all details. I made basic sketches of the animated flows and arranged it in a rough pattern to create a visualisation. This gave me a better idea of how the visualisation will look.</p>


    <h2>Final Visualisations</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 54px;">The Visualisations are designed to be displayed on bigger screens like smartboards or on a wall using a projector in awareness campaigns. The visualisations will not be presented as a whole image, instead they will be scrolled through to read about and understand different parts.</p>

    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('amr/1.gif'); padding-top: 131%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>
    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('amr/2.gif'); padding-top: 164%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>
    <div class="coverimage" style="background-image: url('amr/4.jpg'); padding-top: 131%; margin-bottom: 54px;"></div>

    <p>Antimicrobial Resistance is one of those problems that require sustainable development. It is spreading with speed and people are failing to acknowledge the threat it poses. As we progress it is important that our young generations are aware of all the difficulties that can be caused with uncontrolled use of antimicrobials.<br><br>This project has been an interesting journey to discover how people think and perceive things that surround them since their childhood. The aim of these visualisations is not to solve the problem of antimicrobial resistance but to spread awareness in students and create curiosity.  The visualisation addresses all the main factors required to understand the matter in depth. Once this concept reaches the students through these visualisations, it will help create a better sense of responsibility towards antimicrobials and lead to behaviour change.</p>
